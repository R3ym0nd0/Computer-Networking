1. Application Layer
What It Does: This layer provides network services directly to user applications, enabling communication over the network.
Key Protocols:
- HTTP/HTTPS: For web browsing.
- FTP: For file transfers.
- SMTP: For email sending.
Think of It As: The interface where software applications communicate with the network.

2. Presentation Layer
What It Does: This layer formats and translates data between the application layer and the network. It ensures that data is in a usable format.
Key Functions:
- Data encryption/decryption.
- Data compression.
- Syntax translation (e.g., converting between different character sets).
Think of It As: The translator that ensures data is understandable for both ends.

3. Session Layer
What It Does: This layer manages sessions (connections) between applications. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.
Key Functions:
- Session establishment.
- Session management (keeping track of the connection).
- Session termination.
Think of It As: The mediator that manages the communication sessions between applications.

4. Transport Layer
What It Does: This layer ensures reliable or fast data transfer between systems, managing error correction and flow control.
Key Protocols:
- TCP: Provides reliable, ordered delivery of a stream of data.
- UDP: Offers faster, but less reliable transmission.
Think of It As: The delivery service that ensures packages arrive correctly and in order.

5. Network Layer
What It Does: This layer handles routing and addressing, determining how data is sent across the network.
Key Protocol:
- IP: Responsible for logical addressing and routing of packets.
Think of It As: The navigation system that determines the best path for data to reach its destination.

6. Data Link Layer
What It Does: This layer provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error correction from the physical layer.
Key Functions:
- Framing: Dividing data into frames.
- MAC addressing: Using hardware addresses to identify devices on the same local network.
Think of It As: The highway that transports data frames between devices on the same local network.

7. Physical Layer
What It Does: This layer deals with the physical connection between devices, including the electrical signals, light signals, or radio waves used to transmit data.
Key Functions:
- Defines cables, switches, and the physical aspects of the network.
Think of It As: The physical medium (cables, fiber optics, wireless) through which data travels.
