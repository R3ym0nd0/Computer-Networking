IPv4 Addresses:
Format: Consists of four octets (8 bits each), represented in decimal format, separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
Range: Can range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.

Network Address: The starting address of a range of IP addresses that identifies a specific network or subnet.
Broadcast Address: The highest address in that range, used to send data packets to all devices within that network or subnet simultaneously.

Classes:
Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 (large networks).
Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 (medium networks).
Class C: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 (small networks).
Class D: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (multicast).
Class E: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (experimental).

Example:
IPV4 - 97.32.100.24

Translate into Binary:
1st Octet 97 - 01100001
2nd Octet 32 - 00100000
3rd Octet 100 - 01100100
4th Octet 24 - 00011000
