Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique used in networking to manage IP addresses and facilitate the sharing of a single IP address among multiple devices within a private network. Here’s a detailed breakdown of NAT:

What is NAT?

NAT modifies the IP address information in the packet headers while they are in transit across a router or firewall. The primary purposes of NAT are:

Types of NAT

1. Static NAT (ONE TO ONE):

   - Description: Maps a single private IP address to a single public IP address. This mapping remains constant.
   
   - Use Case:Useful for hosting services or applications that need to be accessible from outside the network, such as a web server or email server.
   
   - Example: Private IP `192.168.1.2` is always mapped to public IP `203.0.113.2`.

2.Dynamic NAT(ONE TO POOL IP):

   - Description: Maps a private IP address to a public IP address from a pool of public IP addresses. The mapping can change each time a device accesses the network.
   
   - Use Case: Provides a way to allocate public IP addresses on an as-needed basis, without a one-to-one mapping.
   
   - Example: Private IP `192.168.1.3` could be mapped to any available public IP from a pool like `203.0.113.2` to `203.0.113.10`.

3.Port Address Translation (PAT) / NAT Overloading(MANY TO ONE):
   - Description: Maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address by using different port numbers. This is the most common type of NAT used in home routers.
   
   - Use Case: Allows multiple devices to access the internet simultaneously using a single public IP address. It’s widely used in residential and small business networks.
   
   - Example: Private IP `192.168.1.4` with port `12345` and `192.168.1.5` with port `12346` might both be mapped to public IP `203.0.113.3` with different port numbers.

How NAT Works

1.Outbound Traffic:

   - When a device within a private network initiates a connection to an external network (like the internet), the NAT router changes the source IP address of the packet from the private IP address to the public IP address.
   
   - The router keeps track of this mapping in a NAT table, which records the original private IP address and port number along with the translated public IP address and port number.

2.Inbound Traffic:

   - When a response comes back from the external network, the NAT router uses the NAT table to determine which internal device the response should be forwarded to.
   
   - The router translates the destination IP address from the public IP address to the corresponding private IP address and forwards the packet to the appropriate internal device.

NAT Table

The NAT table keeps track of the mappings between private and public IP addresses. Each entry includes:

Private IP Address -192.168.43.88
Private Port - 4040
Public IP Address -10.10.10.10
Public Port - 12345 
Protocol - UDP
