FLSM Process:

CIDR Notation: 192.168.43.0/24
Network Range: 192.168.43.0 to 192.168.43.255
Total Hosts: 256

Goal: Number of Subnets: 4
================================================

Steps:

Step 1: Borrowing Bits
To create 4 subnets, use 2 borrowed bits.

Step 2: Adjusting the Prefix Length
Add the 2 borrowed bits to the original prefix length:
/24 + 2 = /26 (New CIDR Notation: 192.168.43.0/26)

Step 3: Identifying the Network Address
Convert the IP address (192.168.43.0) and subnet mask (255.255.255.0) into binary.

Step 4: Subnet Mask in Binary
The original prefix length (/24) means 24 bits:
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
This shows 24 ones and 8 zeros.

Step 5: Convert IP and Subnet Mask to Binary

IP Address: 11000000.10101000.00101011.00000000
Subnet Mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

Step 6: Perform the AND Operation

IP Address: 11000000.10101000.00101011.00000000
Subnet Mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Result: 11000000.10101000.00101011.00000000
(1 AND 1 = 1; 1 AND 0 = 0)

Step 7: Convert Result to IP Address
Use binary place values to convert the result:

1st Octet: 11000000 = 192
2nd Octet: 10101000 = 168
3rd Octet: 00101011 = 43
4th Octet: 00000000 = 0
Network Address: 192.168.43.0

Step 8: Identifying the Broadcast Address
Convert the Network Address (192.168.43.0) to binary and reverse the Subnet Mask for the new prefix length (/26):

Subnet Mask in Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
Reversed: 00000000.00000000.00000000.00111111 (Wild Card Mask)

Step 9: Perform the OR Operation

IP Address: 11000000.10101000.00101011.00000000
Wild Card Mask: 00000000.00000000.00000000.00111111
Result: 11000000.10101000.00101011.00111111
(1 OR 0 = 1; 0 OR 0 = 0)

Step 10: Convert to IP Address
Use binary place values:

1st Octet: 11000000 = 192
2nd Octet: 10101000 = 168
3rd Octet: 00101011 = 43
4th Octet: 00111111 = 63
Broadcast Address: 192.168.43.255
Step 11: Available Hosts in New CIDR Notation
The new CIDR Notation is 192.168.43.0/26.
Subtract from the maximum prefix length (/32): 32 - 26 = 6.
2**6 equals 64.
Available Hosts: 64 - 2 = 62 (Subtracting for Broadcast and Network addresses)

Step 12: Determining the IP Range
IP Range: 192.168.43.0 to 192.168.43.63

Overall Result for 1st Subnet:
Result: 192.168.43.0/26
Network Address: 192.168.43.0
Broadcast Address: 192.168.43.63
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
Prefix Length: /26
Available Hosts: 62
IP Range: 192.168.43.0 to 192.168.43.63

Subsequent Subnets:
For additional subnets, continue from the last result:

Subnet 2: 192.168.43.64/26
Subnet 3: 192.168.43.128/26
Subnet 4: 192.168.43.192/26
