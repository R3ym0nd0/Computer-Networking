VLSM Process:

Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) Process:

CIDR Notation: 192.168.43.0/24
Network Range: 192.168.43.0 to 192.168.43.255
Total Hosts: 256

Goal: Divide into subnets of varying sizes based on host requirements.
Example requirement:

Subnet A: 50 hosts
Subnet B: 30 hosts
Subnet C: 20 hosts
Subnet D: 10 hosts
===========================================================================

Steps:
Step 1: Sort Subnets by Host Requirements
Subnet A: 50 hosts
Subnet B: 30 hosts
Subnet C: 20 hosts
Subnet D: 10 hosts

Step 2: Determine Subnet Sizes (Based on Power of 2)
To satisfy the host requirements:

Subnet A: 64 hosts (requires 6 bits, 2^6 = 64)
Subnet B: 32 hosts (requires 5 bits, 2^5 = 32)
Subnet C: 32 hosts (requires 5 bits, 2^5 = 32)
Subnet D: 16 hosts (requires 4 bits, 2^4 = 16)

Step 3: Assign Subnets in the Address Space
Subnet A

CIDR Notation: 192.168.43.0/26 (64 hosts)
Network Address: 192.168.43.0
Broadcast Address: 192.168.43.63
IP Range: 192.168.43.1 to 192.168.43.62
Available Hosts: 62
Subnet B

CIDR Notation: 192.168.43.64/27 (32 hosts)
Network Address: 192.168.43.64
Broadcast Address: 192.168.43.95
IP Range: 192.168.43.65 to 192.168.43.94
Available Hosts: 30
Subnet C

CIDR Notation: 192.168.43.96/27 (32 hosts)
Network Address: 192.168.43.96
Broadcast Address: 192.168.43.127
IP Range: 192.168.43.97 to 192.168.43.126
Available Hosts: 30
Subnet D

CIDR Notation: 192.168.43.128/28 (16 hosts)
Network Address: 192.168.43.128
Broadcast Address: 192.168.43.143
IP Range: 192.168.43.129 to 192.168.43.142
Available Hosts: 14
