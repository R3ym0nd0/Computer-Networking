Broadcast Address (255.255.255.255): When you first connect to the Wi-Fi, your device uses a broadcast address (255.255.255.255) to send a DHCP Discover message. This is sent to all devices on the network because the client doesn't yet know the address of the DHCP server.

DHCP Offer: The DHCP server receives the Discover message and responds with a DHCP Offer message. This offer includes the IP address and network settings. This Offer is sent to your device's MAC address but is broadcast to the network.

DHCP Request: Your device then sends a DHCP Request message to the server, requesting the offered IP address and settings. This request is also broadcast to the network but specifies your MAC address.

DHCP Acknowledgement (ACK): The DHCP server responds with a DHCP Acknowledgement (ACK) message, confirming the lease and providing the final configuration to your device.
