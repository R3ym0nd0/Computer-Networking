Scenario:
1.Your laptop private IP Address (192.168.43.88) wants to go to default gateway to go to external network but your  laptop didn't know the MAC Address of Default Gateway(Router).
2.Your Private IP address now send an ARP request using broadcast address (255.255.255.255) and all device connect to your network will receive it.


Example:
Who is 192.168.43.1?, give me your MAC Address please.

            ARP Request Packet Details:
            
Source MAC Address: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
Source IP Address: 192.168.43.88
Target IP Address: 192.168.43.1
Target MAC Address: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Step 3 - the router send ARP response now responds and give MAC Address to you. Example:
Hey 192.168.43.88, I'm 192.168.43.1, here's my MAC Address.

            ARP Response Packet Details:

Source IP Address: 192.168.43.1
Source MAC Address: 00:D1:B2:E5:3C:A4            
Target IP Address: 192.168.43.88
Target MAC Address: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E


2.RARP ( Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) - A protocol used by a computer to request its IP address from an administrative host, given its physical MAC address.

Client Sends RARP Request:

1.A device (the RARP client) that needs to find its IP address sends a broadcast RARP request on the local network.
The request contains the client's MAC address.

2.RARP Server Receives Request:
All devices on the local network receive the RARP broadcast, but only the RARP server (or a designated server) listens for RARP requests.

3.RARP Server Looks Up IP Address:
The RARP server checks its local database to find the IP address associated with the MAC address provided in the RARP request.
The database usually contains mappings of MAC addresses to their corresponding IP addresses.

4.RARP Server Sends RARP Reply:
If the server finds a matching IP address, it sends a unicast RARP reply back to the requesting client.
The reply contains the IP address associated with the client's MAC address.

5.Client Receives RARP Reply:
The RARP client receives the reply and can now use the provided IP address for further communication on the network.

6.Client Configures IP Address:
The client configures itself with the obtained IP address and can now participate in IP-based communication on the network.

Summary of RARP Process:
Client → Broadcast RARP request with MAC address.
Server → Receives request and looks up the IP address.
Server → Sends back a unicast RARP reply with the IP address.
Client → Receives the reply and configures the IP address.
