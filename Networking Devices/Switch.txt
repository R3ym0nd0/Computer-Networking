Process of a Switch

1.Receiving a Frame:
- The switch receives a data frame from one of its ports.

2.MAC Address Learning:
- The switch examines the source MAC address of the incoming frame.
It updates its MAC address table (CAM table) by associating the source MAC address with the port it received the frame on.

3.Frame Forwarding:
- The switch checks the destination MAC address in the frame.
- If the MAC address is found in the MAC address table:
  - The switch forwards the frame only to the corresponding port (unicast).
- If the MAC address is not found:
  - The switch broadcasts the frame to all ports except the one it came from (flooding).

4.Collision Domain Management:
Each port operates in its own collision domain, allowing multiple devices to transmit data simultaneously without collisions.

5.Frame Filtering:
- The switch only sends frames to the specific device intended to receive them, thereby reducing unnecessary traffic on the network.

6.Handling VLANs (if supported):
- If the switch supports VLANs, it can segregate traffic within the network based on VLAN configurations, further enhancing network efficiency and security.
