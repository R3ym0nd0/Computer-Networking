Process of a Router

1.Receiving a Packet:
- The router receives a data packet from one of its connected networks.

2.Examining the Packet Header:
- The router examines the destination IP address in the packet header to determine where the packet needs to go.

3.Routing Table Lookup:
- The router checks its routing table to find the best path for the packet based on the destination IP address.
- The routing table contains information about various network destinations and the next hop (next router or device) to reach them.

4.Deciding on the Next Hop:
- If a matching entry is found in the routing table, the router determines the next hop (the next router or device) to which the packet should be forwarded.
- If no matching entry is found, the router may drop the packet or send it to a default route, if one is configured.

5.Packet Forwarding:
- The router encapsulates the packet in a new frame suitable for the outgoing network.
- It forwards the packet to the designated next hop or directly to the destination network, sending it out through the appropriate interface.

6.Network Address Translation (NAT) (if applicable):
- If the router performs NAT, it translates the private IP address of the source device to a public IP address for outgoing packets and vice versa for incoming packets.

7.Handling Routing Protocols (if applicable):
- Routers may use routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, BGP) to dynamically update their routing tables based on network changes, ensuring efficient routing.
