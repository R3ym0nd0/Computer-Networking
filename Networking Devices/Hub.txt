Process of a Hub

1.Receiving a Data Packet:
- The hub receives a data packet from one of its connected devices.

2.Broadcasting the Packet:
- The hub does not check the destination address in the packet. Instead, it broadcasts (repeats) the packet to all other ports, regardless of the intended destination.

3.All Devices Receive the Packet:
- Every device connected to the hub receives the packet, but only the device with the matching destination address processes it. All other devices ignore the packet.

4.Collision Domain:
- All devices connected to a hub share a single collision domain, meaning data packets can collide if multiple devices transmit simultaneously. This reduces efficiency as more devices are added.
